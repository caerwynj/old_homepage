<h3>software</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="tea.tgz">tea</a> for plan9 (<a href="tut.html">Tutorial</a>). 
</ul>
Included in <i>tea</i> are a set of commands that 
implement temporal database operations:
<ul>
<li><a href="tdbjoin.html">tdbjoin</a></li>
<li><a href="tdbadd.html">tdbadd</a></li>
<li><a href="tdbcoin.html">tdbcoin</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
tdbjoin and tdbadd are built using some
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9/">Plan 9</a> libraries.
A unix port of these libraries
can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/~rsc/software/">here</a>.
<ul>
<li><a href="utea.tgz">tea</a> for unix, which includes a unix version of 9ls</li>
</ul>
<p>
The tea script is an application of the tdb tools aimed at 
meta data for a filesystem. That is annotating files with information
about what they contain and when you used them, or how you used them.
This is a poor man's  version  of Gordon Bell's 
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/barc/mediapresence/MyLifeBits.aspx">
MyLifeBits</a>  Project.
<p>
The tdb* tools have other uses also. I use them to index all my text files
as the backend of a search engine. I use them for project tracking, time
tracking  and process control. I use them as a temporal replacement for the /rdb
UNIX tools.
<h3>work in progress</h3>
<h4>PostDate</h4>
PostDate is a language for managing time varying data and code. 
<p>
PostDate's syntax is a postfix (reverse Polish) notation loosely based
on PostScript. It uses bi-temporal (transaction time and valid time) 
binary relations to store and query time varying data.
<p>
Built in operators retrieve temporal triads of time, element, and
attribute values from named relations.  The value associated with a
key may vary with time, and so the value retrieved depends on the
choice of effective valid time.  The value for a given key may contain
PostDate code, which allows procedure definitions to vary along the
valid time line.  The bi-temporal nature of the database also allows
us to set the effective transaction time and review the state of the
database exactly as it appeared on some past date.
<p>
Here is a rough start <a href="pd.tgz">pd.tgz</a> 2003/1128.
And some <a href="pd.html">notes</a>.
