<h1>Notes</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
PostDate is an interpreter for a simple postfix notation.
Objects are pushed onto the operand stack where operators
pop them as required and push back any results.
<p>
An object can be one of number, string, code, or dictionary.
<p>
Strings are enclosed in parentheses
<pre>
(this is a string)
(this is a (string) with nested parens)
</pre>
<p>
Code is quoted by braces
<pre>
{1 1 add} exec print
</pre>
Numbers and declared names and builtins are referred to
directly. There are some builtin operators, defined below.
New operators can be defined and stored in dictionaries.
Operators are referred to by literal names that are searched
for in the dictionary stack. Dictionaries can be pushed or popped
from this stack.
<p>
Along with the operand and dictionary stacks, there is an execution
stack and implicit valid-time stack. The execution stack  always
has an effective valid time which is used to look up objects
in any of the dictionaries. As code is pushed onto the stack the
valid time associated with that code object is pushed onto
the valid-time stack thereby becoming the effective valid time.
<p>
Every operand object has a valid-time. For interactive use of the
postdate interpreter, the valid-time is usually
the current time. But for objects looked up from a dictionary the
valid-time is the time the object was entered into the dictionary.
The valid-time of an operand can be changed using the <i>date</i> operator.
<p>
The <i>date</i> operator takes a string and an object as operands and
interprets the string as a date specifiction in the format YYYYMMDD 
where YYYYMM are optional. Some special symbols are recognized.
Dot, ".", is the current time, "^", is the startof the epoch, and "$" is the end.

<h2>Examples</h2>
Refer to operator definitions below.
<p>
Create a new dictionary called <i>t1</i> in the current directory; 
define some values in the dictionary;
then step through contents of dictionary.
<pre>
(t1) dict begin
(a) 1 def
(b) 2 def
t1 save
t1 {print print} forall
</pre>

<p>
Open the same dictionary as above and define a function to add <i>a</i> and 
<i>b</i>.
Execute it and print the result.
<pre>
(t1) dict begin
(c) {a b add} def
t1 save
c print
</pre>

<p>
In the same dictionary define <i>a</i> to a different value and 
execute <i>c</i> again. What is the result?
<pre>
(t1) dict begin
(a) 2 def
t1 save
c print
</pre>

<p>
Set the effective valid time of the function to the current
time before executing it, therefore taking the most recent
definition of <i>a</i>.
<pre>
(t1) dict begin
(c) load (.) date exec print
</pre>

<h2>TODO</h2>
<ul>
<li>String handling functions including regex, subs, gsub, etc.
<li>Extended precision arithmetic.
<li>Pipes, streams, channels. The best way of building up
queries of btrees and calculating results is using pipelines. 
Either we create them as part of the language or we stick
to using standard shell pipelines and create convenience
methods for pd to work as a filter.
<li>Error handling and type checking.
<li>A hash table without temporal properties (a dict that is not a tdb Btree).
<li>Coincidence operator
</ul>
<h2>Bugs</h2>
Many, many, many.
Memory handling is very bad; there are several leaks including
<ul>
<li>Strings pushed onto execution stack aren't released
<li>Btree's are not freed
<li>No special char quoting yet
<ul>
